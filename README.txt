How To Use Submission:

1) opening the zip folder
    - open the zip folder, and copy all the contents from the submitted folder into a new folder(including the ServerFiles folder and Client_Files folder)
    - use this new folder to test the files
2) what is in the zip folder?
    - the zip contains 
        - 1x Server.py file
        - 1x ServerDetails.py file
        - 3x client.py files
        - 1x ServerFiles folder
        - 1x Client_Files folder
    - to ensure that the files run smoothly, make sure to copy ALL the contents from the submitted folder into a new folder

    - it is easiest to use upload/download files when the files are in the same directory as the submitted
      client and server files

    1) start the Server
    2) start the client using command line arguments in the following format: Python client.py "ip address" 5050 "request"
